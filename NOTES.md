Technology Used:

1. React and Typescript
2. Redux - For maintaining products state - It is not required for this assessment but considering it as a product of long term, I included redux with Typescript.
3. Separated Components/core and Components/shared - Core is created with an intention that It can be extract out and developed as a new library if Design System is already in place.
4. React-router-dom v6 is used to render / route - as of today. It will be required when Product Details, CART, WISHLIST, support and other modules comes into picture.

TODO:
